##### ## the morn##g light,
##### climb##g hills ## flight.
##### with the patient eyes,
##### where the silence lies.

##### trudg##g dusty roads,
##### bear##g heavy loads.
##### under ### and ra##,
##### feel##g all the stra##.

##### hears no word of praise,
##### walks through endless days.
##### strong with little pride,
##### takes it all ## stride.

##### soft, a gentle soul,
##### plays a thankless role.
##### mocked and made a jest,
##### still gives all his best.

#####’s back is bowed and sore,
#####’s heart holds someth##g more.
#####, friend to poor and meek,
##### never turns his cheek.

#####, symbol of pure grace,
##### steady keeps his pace.
##### teaches what is true—
##### does what few would do.

So s##g of donkey, not ## va##—
##### brave through joy and pa##.
#####, donkey, noble beast,
On your soul, the least are feast.
